## Description
This project is a desktop application model designed for an online video game key store. It features a user-friendly graphical interface tailored for game buyers. Users have the ability to create accounts, log in, and make game purchases. Additionally, administrators can manage the catalog by viewing, modifying, or removing various video game listings.
The application provides comprehensive statistical insights into store performance, including the history of successful and unsuccessful purchases, often due to insufficient balance or a shortage of game keys. The payment processing mechanism is implemented through a dedicated class that simulates credit card payments.
It's important to note that this project utilizes a local database, specifically MySQL. Users are required to create this database prior to engaging in any actions within the application.
This project showcases an effective and user-friendly solution for managing an online video game key store, offering both buyers and administrators a seamless experience.
